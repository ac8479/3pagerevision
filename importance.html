      <p class="contentText">It is no secret that a good education has the power to change a life. What is new is the demand for that change.<br> <br>

Governments are investing more than ever before on educating their citizens, eager for them to compete in the global workforce. A growing global middle class is spending more of its own money on educating their families. Employers are looking for a new sort of colleague - someone with the skills to flourish in the 21st century. Combined with technologies that continue to develop at breakneck speed, the result is a world that has the want, and the means, to learn at scale.<br> <br>

Yet there is so much to be done. One in five adults lack the written communication skills they need to progress in life, and 57 million children do not know what it's like to step inside a classroom. Many millions more are in education, but not learning effectively.<br> <br>

The global challenge for education is not just about providing access, but also ensuring progress.<br> <br>

As the worldâ€™s leading learning company, we can help make a difference. But we also know that the challenges are too immense to tackle alone. So we're fostering a global community of teachers, parents, students, governments, institutions and businesses, who can help us find the answers and deploy the solutions.</p>
